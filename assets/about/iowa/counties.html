<p>Iowa has strict laws requiring that congressional districts be built out of counties. The county shapefile comes from the US Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a>. 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from <a href="https://www.data.census.gov">data.census.gov</a>. County level election data for presidential elections since 2000 were obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/MEDSL/official-precinct-returns">MIT Elections Data and Science Lab</a>. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional informationabout processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/IA-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.</p>
