<p>In the 1920s, researchers at the University of Chicago divided the city into 77 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago">community areas</a> that have played an important role in city planning and culture since their inception and serve as proxies for neighborhoods.  The community area and precinct shapefiles were downloaded from the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6">Chicago Data Portal</a>. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at the block level from <a href="https://wwww.data.census.gov">data.census.gov</a>. The source shapefiles with demographic information are available for download from <a href="https://github.com/mggg/chicago/tree/master/shapefiles">MGGG's GitHub organization</a>.</p>
