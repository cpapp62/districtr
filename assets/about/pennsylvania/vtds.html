    The raw, unprocessed VTDs were collected from the Census <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a>. Election data was compiled at the precinct level by a private individual and was found to be within 1% of the official state-reported results at the county and state levels. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at the block level from <a href="https://www.data.census.gov">data.census.gov</a>. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/PA-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.
